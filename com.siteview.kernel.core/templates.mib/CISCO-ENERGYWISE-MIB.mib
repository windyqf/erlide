    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB is used to manage and optimize power usage
        in networks. 

        Cisco EnergyWise is a specification of data, discovery and
        protocols for managing power on and between network devices.

        An entity is Cisco EnergyWise compatible, if it complies with
        Cisco EnergyWise specification.

        A Cisco EnergyWise entity is characterized by the power related
        attributes of a physical entity present in ENTITY-MIB. 

        Cisco EnergyWise solves the problem of Network Power
        Management.   One of goals of Cisco EnergyWise is to manage
        power on network level.  Some solutions in FCAPS have focused on
        managing a single element but Cisco EnergyWise provides the
        capability to handle the management of a network of devices, as
        well as a single device. 

        Concepts and Definitions:
        =========================
        Cisco EnergyWise Entity: A physical entity that is part of the
        network that provides power or draws power from another 
        part of the network.

        Cisco EnergyWise Level: A uniform way to classify power
        settings on an ENEGRYWISE entity.  Levels are guidelines for
        the manufacturers of entity (e.g., shut, hibernate, sleep,
        standby).

        Cisco EnergyWise Usage: The consumption of power by a Cisco
        EnergyWise entity in watts.

            Current         The current power consumption by an 
                            Cisco EnergyWise entity.

            Provisioned     The maximum power a Cisco EnergyWise
                            entity can draw in the current level.

            Usage Vector    A vector 0..10 representing the maximum
                            power a Cisco EnergyWise entity can draw at
                            each level. 

            Delta Vector    This defines a vector 0..10 representing
                            the difference between the Current and
                            Usage Vector for each level.

        Cisco EnergyWise Entity Power Unit: This is used to represent
        smaller or larger quantities of Cisco EnergyWise usage and
        conforms to the standard prefixes for the SI (System
        International) units of measure.  The value represents an
        exponent of 10.

            For example, if current usage of an ENERGYWSIE entity is 
            3, it could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 KW, 3 MW depending on the value
            of Cisco EnergyWise power unit, i.e. 0, -3, 3, or 6 
            respectively.

        Cisco EnergyWise Domain: A collection of entities that is
        divided into manageable sets.  Switch, IP phones, IP cameras,
        lighting controllers can be Cisco EnergyWise entities, all part
        of a domain.  A domain can contain multiple devices.

        Cisco EnergyWise Entity Importance: The importance attribute of
        an entity enables the management station to differentiate other
        Cisco EnergyWise entities in the domain with a different
        business context.  This also provides a choice to the
        administrators to manage power in context of importance.

            For example, assuming we have 2 phones deployed in a
            enterprise.  One phone is in a shared spare office and one 
            used by trader generating lot of money as part of core
            business of enterprise.

            This clearly demonstrates that the phone used by trader is
            more important than the phone used in the spare office.

        Nanny Vector: A vector of bits, representing different features
        (E.g., sleep, wakeup, shutdown) supported on a Cisco
        EnergyWise entity.  Setting of some of the features on the
        Cisco EnergyWise entity can be managed by itself, but for some
        others, a parent has to nanny.

        Nanny: An ENEGRYWISE entity acts on behalf of another 
        another Cisco EnergyWise entity.

        Cisco EnergyWise Parent: A Cisco EnergyWise entity that does
        not have a nanny vector.  This entity can manage all its power
        setting for itself as well as for Cisco EnergyWise entities
        contained in it.  The contained in relationship is same as
        defined in ENTITY-MIB. 

        Cisco EnergyWise Child: A Cisco EnergyWise entity that has a
        nanny vector.  It requires a Cisco EnergyWise parent to serve
        as nanny.  Depending on the nanny vector a Cisco EnergyWise
        child can be fully or partially managed.  

        Cisco EnergyWise Neighbor: A Cisco EnergyWise entity to which
        Cisco EnergyWise protocol events can be forwarded to.  An
        entity can either discover a neighbor using a discovery
        protocol, or the neighbor can be configured as a static neighbor
        by the Management station.  A Cisco EnergyWise parent may also
        nanny a Cisco EnergyWise neighbor.

            For example, A Cisco EnergyWise compatible entity like an
            IP phone, connected to a port on the switch, can provide a 
            nanny vector to the switch to serve as a nanny.

        Cisco EnergyWise Proxy: A device attached to a port that does
        not understand the Cisco EnergyWise protocol, but has the
        provision to manage power through network APIs or a proprietary
        protocol.  

        A Proxy is always configured on a port.  It allows the
        Cisco EnergyWise protocol to be used with other non networking
        devices that draw power indirectly. 

            For example, a lighting controller (building lighting 
            controller) is a nonnetworking device which does not
            understand Cisco EnergyWise protocol.  However, it runs a 
            proprietary BACNET protocol.

        The following diagram represents the relationship between 
        cewEntityTable and cewNeighborTable, 
        cewEntityTable and cewProxyTable.

                                          -----------------------------

        Cisco EnergyWise Event: It is a policy that can be either
        configured on a Cisco EnergyWise entity or received from
        other Cisco EnergyWise entities.  Using this, a Cisco
        EnergyWise entity can adjust its power settings according
        to some criteria, typically time.

            For example, a Management station can configure an
            ENERGYWSIE event on a switch to control devices in branch 
            offices, to go to power level standby at 8pm and power
            level full at 7am."
