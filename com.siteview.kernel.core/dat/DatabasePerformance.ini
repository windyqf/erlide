[Data buffer]
Measurement1=Size              kb
Description1=The size of the databse pool,which holds the database blocks in the working storage and therefore, reduces time-consuming hard disk accesses.
Measurement2=Reads
Description2=The number of read accesses which could be satisfied directly (without hard disk access) from the database buffer pool.
Measurement3=Quality            %
Description3=The quality specifies how high the percentage of the reads without hard disk accesses from the total quantity of read accesses to the database buffer pool is.
Measurement4=Physical reads
Description4=Number of database blocks read physically from the hard disk.
Measurement5=writes
Description5=No Description
Measurement6=Buffer busy waits
Description6=No Description
Measurement7=Buffer wait time   s
Description7=No Description

[Shared Pool]
Measurement1=Size              kb
Description1=Size of the dictionary buffer in KB.The dictionary buffer has the function to store data dictionary information which is frequently required in the working storage which facilitates the acess.
Measurement2=DD-Cache quality   %
Description2=Quality of the data dictionary cache in Oracle7.This value specifies how frequently the Oracle data dictionary has to be accessed when processing SQL commands. In the installed system, this value should at least be 90%.
Measurement3=SQL Area getratio  %
Description3=Hit rate for the number of requests of objects which are managed in the library cache of Oracle7. A high value suggests a good sizing of the shared pool.
Measurement4=pinratio  %
Description4=Hit rate for the number of executions of objects which are managed in the library cache of Oracle7. A high value suggests a good sizing of the shared pool.
Measurement5=reloads/pins %
Description5=SQL area reloads (%) from v$librarycache

[Log buffer]
Measurement1=Size              kb
Description1=Size of the redo log buffer in KB.In the redo log buffer, all changes to the database are logged.
Measurement2=Entries
Description2=The number of entries in the redo log buffer.
Measurement3=Allocation retries
Description3=Frequency, with which a user process could not allocate sufficient space in the redo log buffer and had to start a further attempt. This case can then occur if the redo writer is working less efficiently or if an event occurs such as a log switch.
Measurement4=Alloc fault rate   %
Description4=The percentage of aborted allocation attempts (allocation fault) from the total quantity of entries in the redo log buffer (entries).
Measurement5=Redo log wait      s
Description5=Redo log space wait time (s) from v$sysstat
Measurement6=Log files (in use)
Description6=Number of redo log files.

[Calls]
Measurement1=User calls
Description1=The number of user calls started for the database.
Measurement2=Recursive calls
Description2=Number of recursive database calls. A high value indicates the information was frequently not found in the dictionary buffer. The dictionary buffer may be sized too small or has been parsed too many times.
Measurement3=commits
Description3=The number of commits carried out (finished transactions).
Measurement4=Parses
Description4=Number of parses runs. This number should be reduced by application tuning if possible.
Measurement5=rollbacks
Description5=The number of the executed rollbacks (rolling back incomplete transactions).
Measurement6=User/Recursive calls
Description6=Ratio of user to recursive calls in Oracle7 monitor.
Measurement7=Reads / User calls
Description7=Ratio of reads to user calls in Oracle7.

[Time statistics]
Measurement1=Busy wait time     s
Description1=Oracle: Busy wait time (from v$System_Event) (sec).
Measurement2=Sessions busy      %
Description2=Oracle: Sessions busy (%).
Measurement3=CPU time           s
Description3=Oracle: Total CPU time used by Oracle (sec).
Measurement4=CPU usage          %
Description4=Oracle: CPU usage by Oracle (%).
Measurement5=Time/User call    ms
Description5=Oracle: Time per user call (ms).
Measurement6=CPU count
Description6=Number of CPUs.

[Redo logging]
Measurement1=Writes
Description1=the number of write operations which were executed on the redo log file. A database background process, the logwriter, cyclically transfers the contents of the redo log buffer into the redo log file.
Measurement2=Write time         s
Description2=The time in milliseconds which was needed for writing to the redo log file.
Measurement3=OS-Blocks written
Description3=number of blocks which were written into the redo log file.
Measurement4=Mb written
Description4=The number of MB which were written to the redo log file.
Measurement5=Latching time      s
Description5=The time which the logwriter process needed to recieve and release the necessary latches (short-term locks of data structures) to the redo log.

[Table scans & fetches]
Measurement1=Short table scans
Description1=Number of read access to tables with a maximum size of 4 database blocks.
Measurement2=Long table scans
Description2=Number of read access to tables with at least 4 database blocks.
Measurement3=Fetch by rowid
Description3=The number of blocks which were read via ROWID. the ROWID is a logical byte address which identifies every data record in the database and links it with the index value.
Measurement4=by continued row
Description4=Number of accesses to concatenated database blocks (row chaining).The number should be as low as possible, otherwise, the affected tables should be reorganized.

[Sorts]
Measurement1=Memory
Description1=The number of sorting operations which could be carried out in memory.
Measurement2=Disk
Description2=The number of sorting operations which were carried out on the hard disk in the temporary segments provided for this. This is necessary if sorting operations cannot be handled completely in memory.
Measurement3=Rows sorted
Description3=Number of lines which were sorted.
